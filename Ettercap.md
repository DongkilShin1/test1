## What is Ettercap?
[Ettercap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ettercap_(software)) is originally one of packet analyzers such as wireshark, tcpdump. However, tt is commonly called as a packet sniffer because it is capable of intercepting data streams which flow on computer networks, and these captured packets are decoded and analyzed through proper RFCs or protocols by the tool. Therefore, it can be used as a tool for man-in-the-middle ***(MITM)*** attacks on local area network (LAN). By default, it has the ability to conduct eavesdropping, filter packets and collect passwords. Moreover, its features can be extended by custom plugins using its API as it has plugin suppport. It works by putting its network interface into promiscuous mode (pass its traffic of interface to CPU) and by ***ARP poisoning*** the target machines. It also has the ability to actively or passively find other poisoners on the LAN.
